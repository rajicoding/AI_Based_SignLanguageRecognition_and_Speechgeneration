🤟 AI-Based Sign Language Recognition and Speech Generation
📌 Project Overview

Communication can be challenging when sign language users interact with people who are unfamiliar with sign language. This project aims to bridge that gap by using Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning to recognize sign language alphabets in real time and convert them into text and speech.

The system captures hand signs through a webcam, recognizes the corresponding alphabet using a trained MobileNetV2 model, forms meaningful sentences, and generates voice output for both individual letters and complete sentences.

🎯 Features

✅ Real-time hand sign detection

✅ Sign language alphabet recognition (A–Z)

✅ AI-powered classification using MobileNetV2

✅ Confidence score display

✅ Prediction smoothing for stable recognition

✅ Letter-by-letter voice feedback

✅ Real-time sentence formation

✅ Space, Delete, and Clear controls

✅ Complete sentence speech generation

✅ User-friendly interface
